 Artificial Intelligence Workshop With Pytorch

## Introduction to tensors


## Notes 
Pytorch provides trnsor computation with strong gpu acceleration
It enables convinent implementation of nural networks

Tensor is a data structure, neural nets are fundamentally structuren as tensors.
A tensor is Generalization of matrices with n dimentions. 

![Basic Tensor Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShumailaAhmed/AI-Workshop/main/tensors.png?token=ALS5FOFOIKBHZSLPVMXH23TAC2N7G)

1. a zero dimentional vector is called scalar  
2. a one dimentional tensor is called vector   
3. a two dimentional tensors are matrices  
4. a 3d tensors called tensor.
