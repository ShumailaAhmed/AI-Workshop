 Artificial Intelligence Workshop With Pytorch

## Introduction to tensors


## Notes 
Pytorch provides trnsor computation with strong gpu acceleration
It enables convinent implementation of nural networks

Tensor is a data structure, neural nets are fundamentally structuren as tensors.
A tensor is Generalization of matrices with n dimentions.

*a zero dimentional vector is called scalar  
*a one dimentional tensor is called vector   
*a two dimentional tensors are matrices  
*and 3d tensors called tensor.
