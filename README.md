 Artificial Intelligence Workshop With Pytorch

## Introduction to tensors


## Notes 
Pytorch provides trnsor computation with strong gpu acceleration
It enables convinent implementation of nural networks

Tensor is a data structure, neural nets are fundamentally structuren as tensors.
A tensor is Generalization of matrices with n dimentions. 

![Basic Tensor Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShumailaAhmed/AI-Workshop/main/tensors.png?token=ALS5FOFOIKBHZSLPVMXH23TAC2N7G)

1. a zero dimentional vector is called scalar  
2. a one dimentional tensor is called vector   
3. a two dimentional tensors are matrices  
4. a 3d tensors called tensor.  

## Tensor Operations

Open google colab  

```!pip install torch
import torch

oneDTensor = torch.tensor([1,2,3])

print(oneDTensor)
print(oneDTensor.dtype)

```
 Indexing Tensors is similar to indexing python list
 
 ```
 print(oneDTensor[0])
 ```
Slicing the tensor is just like slicing the python list

```
oneDTensor = torch.tensor([1,2,3,4,5,6])
print(oneDTensor[:4])
```

we can also define float tensors

```
 floatTensor= torch.FloatTensor([1,2,3,4,5,6])
 print (floatTensor)
 print(floatTensor.dtype)
 ```
 
 size of tensor is determined by size method
 
 ```print(floatTensor.size())```
 
 
 reshape the tensor just like numpy.reshape function 
 
 ```floatTensor.view(6,1)
 floatTensor.view(6,2) #throws error
 floatTensor.view(3,2)
 floatTensor.view(2,-1)
 ```
 
 ### Convert numpy array into Tensors
 
 ```import numpy as np
 array = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
 tensor= torch.from_numpy(array) #convert numpy array to tensor
 print(tensor)
 numpy = tensor.numpy()
 print(numpy)
